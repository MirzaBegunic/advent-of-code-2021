# advent-of-code-2021

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
In this repository I will post my solutions to Advent of Code programming puzzles for 2021 year, and my language of choice is Kotlin :smile:
